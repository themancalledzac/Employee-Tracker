## Description

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## User Story

```

## Acceptance Criteria

```

- Add departments, roles, employees

- View departments, roles, employees

- Update employee roles

Bonus points if you're able to:

- Update employee managers

- View employees by manager

- Delete departments, roles, and employees

- View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department
```
